# Used-cars-Data
## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of used cars to extract insights on pricing, trends, and key factors affecting resale value. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and model building.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various used cars, including details such as make, model, year, price, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant attributes.

## Features

- Make & Model: The brand and specific model of the car.

- Year: The manufacturing year of the car.

- Price: The selling price of the used car.

- Mileage: The total distance covered by the car.

- Fuel Type: The type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.).

- Transmission: Type of gearbox (Manual/Automatic).

- Other Features: Additional attributes such as horsepower, engine size, and vehicle condition.

## Analysis Performed

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing duplicates.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and key statistics.

- Visualization: Creating graphs and charts to identify trends.

- Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships between price and other variables.

- Predictive Modeling: Building regression models to predict used car prices.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (for data analysis and modeling)

- Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)

- Scikit-learn (machine learning models)
  
- Jupyter Notebook (code execution environment)

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into factors affecting used car prices and helps in making data-driven decisions. Further improvements can be made by integrating additional features or fine-tuning predictive models.
